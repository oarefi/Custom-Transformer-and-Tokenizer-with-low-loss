##Transformer Model for Translation

This repository contains the code for a Transformer model used for translation tasks. The Transformer model is a deep learning model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation.

##Installation
To use this code, you need to have Python installed. Clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your training data: You need to provide a CSV file containing the source language sentences and the corresponding target language sentences. The CSV file should have two columns: "source" and "target". Each row represents a sentence pair.

##Initialize the tokenizer: The tokenizer is responsible for tokenizing the sentences and converting them into numerical representations. To initialize the tokenizer, create an instance of the Tokenizer class and load the vocabulary dictionary from a JSON file using the load_word2idx method.

#Tokenize the sentences: Use the tokenize method of the tokenizer to convert the sentences into tokenized form. This step is necessary to prepare the data for training the model.

#Prepare the input tensors: Pad or truncate the tokenized sentences to a fixed length using the max_seq_length variable. This ensures that all sentences have the same length. Convert the tokenized sentences into tensors using torch.tensor.

#Define the Transformer model: Instantiate an instance of the Transformer class and specify the required parameters such as source and target vocabulary size, model dimensions, number of attention heads, number of layers, and dropout rate.

#Train the model: Use the prepared input tensors as the input to the forward method of the Transformer model. The model will perform the forward pass and return the output predictions.

#Translate sentences: Use the translate_sentence method of the Transformer model to translate a given sentence from the source language to the target language. This method takes a sentence as input, tokenizes it, performs the translation, and returns the translated sentence.
